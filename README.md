# MOG-AUTOCLICKER

Made by @misterofgames_yt! This autoclicker is very fast. the cps can go from 1 to 10 thousand (10k or 10000). It has right click and left click. It has a Toggle key which is the key G. 

# TUTORIAL HOW TO RUN:
Requirements: python 3.11 or higher (made in python 3.11 so recommended.)

If it still doesn't run you should open CMD (or command promt) and copy paste this ```pip install keyboard mouse pyautogui tk ttkthemes pywin32 threading time messagebox ttk tkinter```.
This command installs all of the things needed for the autoclicker!
